## Current temp settings

Using the thumbs up button you should see the actual measurements at the top right of the display.

- 84 (R) 
  > this should be room temperature (but the room temp was measured at 23 ˚C, which should translate to 74˚F)
- 166 (S) 
  > this should be exhaust temperature
- 44 (P) 
  > this should be protection temperature

But these seem odd to me.
