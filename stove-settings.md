## Current temp settings

Using the thumbs up button you should see the actual measurements at the top right of the display.

- 84 (R) 
  > this should be room temperature (but the room temp was measured at 23 ËšC, which should translate to 74ËšF)
  >
  > Looking better at this, it seems that someone has soldered a new sensor onto the cable, which was a 10KÎ© NTC, a 100KÎ© NTC seems to fit better
- 166 (S) 
  > this should be exhaust temperature
- 44 (P) 
  > this should be protection temperature

But these seem odd to me.

## Stove settings after main MCU and display swap

The main MCU started giving a lot of errors. All three of the temperature sensors failed and I couldn't find out what was wrong.  
So I needed to swap the hardware including the display. ðŸ˜ 

Here is the new configuration.
