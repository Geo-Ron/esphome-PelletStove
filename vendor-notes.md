- If being installed in a mobile/trailer home, the fresh air intake kit needs to be installed
- UL 103 HT PL venting is only required for installation in mobile/trailer homes
  - If 3-inch venting is not available, installer can use an adapter to use larger venting
  - All other installations can use UL 641 PL venting
